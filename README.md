This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to run the webapp

`git clone https://github.com/Soupcodes/front-end-tech-test.git` into a folder through a terminal<br>
`cd front-end-tech-test` to access the folder<br>
Open in your preferred IDE

## Run Scripts

Once open in your IDE, run:

### `npm i`

This will download and install all relevant dependencies required to run the webapp

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### With extra time:

With extra time, I would have liked to try building the pages in TypeScript, and CSS Styled Components as opposed to css modules.

In terms of functionality and the code itself, I would have spent more time understanding how the carousel component is rendered, to be able to render a full product, description alongside the images in one component / card as opposed to splitting the logic which I am aware currently causes issues when trying to add a second object into products page.

It would have also been fun to determine what types of authentication may be required to resolve a checkout situation as I have not come across dealing with live payments before
